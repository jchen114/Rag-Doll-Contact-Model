# Walking-Rag-Doll
To make a rag doll walking controller

A 2D biped physics simulated walker. 

This is an implementation of the SIMBICON Paper found [here](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/Simbicon.htm)

Follow progress on my [website](http://chenjacob.com/recent-news/).

The biped tries its best to hit 4 target states while in motion by applying torques on each segment. (The torso's torque is realized by the upper legs) See paper for details.
